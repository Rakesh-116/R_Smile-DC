                            Regular brushing and flossing are essential, but they canâ€™t remove hardened tartar that
                            traps bacteria and increases your risk of cavities and gum disease. Professional cleaning
                            ensures your teeth and gums stay healthy, removing plaque and tartar from places your
                            toothbrush can't reach.
                        </p>

                        A deep cleaning, also known as scaling and root planing, goes below the gum line to remove
                        tartar and bacteria. This is recommended if plaque and tartar have caused gum inflammation,
                        tissue loss, or bone damage.
